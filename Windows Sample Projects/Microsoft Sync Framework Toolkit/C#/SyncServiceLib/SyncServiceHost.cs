    /// WebServiceHost is a ServiceHost derived class that compliments the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) Web programming model.
    /// 
    /// If WebServiceHost finds no endpoints in the service description, it automatically creates a default endpoint 
    /// at the service's base address for HTTP and HTTPS base addresses. 
    /// It does not create an endpoint automatically if the user has configured an endpoint explicitly at the base address. 
    /// WebServiceHost automatically configures the endpoint's binding to work with the associated 
    /// Internet Information Services (IIS) security settings when used in a secure virtual directory. 
    /// 
    /// When creating a default HTTP endpoint, the WebServiceHost also disables the HTTP Help page 
    /// and the Web Services Description Language (WSDL) GET functionality so the metadata endpoint 
    /// does not interfere with the default HTTP endpoint.
    /// 
    /// In addition, the WebServiceHost class adds the WebHttpBehavior to all endpoints that do not already 
    /// have the behavior and that have a WebMessageEncodingElement. 
    /// If all the operations on the service have either empty HTTP request bodies or deal with the 
    /// HTTP request body as a stream, then the WebServiceHost automatically 
    /// configures the appropriate content type mapper for the binding.
